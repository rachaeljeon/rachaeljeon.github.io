                            One of my favorite hobbies of all time has been journaling. <br></br>
                            <p></p>
                            To me, journaling has been my main source to simply get to know more about myself.
                            It's an intimate place where I share my deeply rooted emotions and feelings.
                            And as such, I truly believe this act has brought me closer to myself, and I mean my truest self.  <br></br>
                            <p></p>
                            It's as if the act of journaling has made me assure that I've made a secret promise to myself to devote to myself to be intentional and real.
                            There's no shame, there's no judgement. It's a freezone. That's why I can be free and show my most vulnerable, authentic self.  <br></br>
                            <p></p>
                            As a human being progresses through life, I firmly believe it's crucial for one to come back and reconnect with oneself. And for me, journaling has been that one way.

                                Every season you come back with your leaves again. <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                No matter how tough last season may have been, you come back. <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                This time, a little stronger, fuller, taller, bigger, and healthier. <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                Because that’s how you grow. <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                Growth is overcoming the harsh times. Now, you have thicker skin. <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                At some point in time, you will age and derail. <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                Not because you’re getting weaker. But because with time, everything - even trees - leaves the Earth. <br></br>
                                <br></br>
                                So branch out as much as you can and live your fullest life.<br></br>
